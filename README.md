# Outsurance Assessment - Reuel Lawrence (reuel.lawrence@gmail.com)
The solution is in the form of a console app written in C#.

For simplicity in running the solution, a sample CSV file has been included. Please add the following Command Line argument to the main project:
SampleInput.csv

Then simply hitting Ctrl+F5 will run the solution, and two output files will be generated and saved in the bin/debug folder:
1. nameStats.csv
2. addressStats.csv

Note that you can supply additional command line arguments to specify the names of these files.

Unit tests were written using the NUnit 3 and Moq frameworks.
